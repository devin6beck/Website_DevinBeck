<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Devin Beck. Originally from Arizona, I've made Taos, New Mexico 
  my home since 2012.
</p>

<p>
  For a decade, I embraced the outdoors, spending my summers as a river guide 
  and my winters snowboarding and working as a sales supervisor at Taos Ski Valley.
  However, my passion for technology led me to a recent transition into a full-time 
  IT professional role at Taos Ski Valley, even though I still guide on the weekends.
</p>

<h2>My Wife and Our Story</h2>
<p>
  Life's adventures are even better with my incredible wife, Hannah, by my side.
  Together, we've explored mountains and rivers, building a beautiful life in Taos. 
  She's the proud owner of <a href="https://taosbestcleaning.com/">Taos Best Cleaning</a>.
</p>

<h2>My Career</h2>
<p>
  My career journey has been an intriguing blend of diverse experiences. From navigating 
  the thrilling outdoors to diving into the ever-evolving world of IT, I am now focusing 
  on expanding my development skills.
