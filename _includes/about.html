      <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
      <p>Originally from Arizona, I've made Taos, New Mexico my home since 2012. For a
          decade, I embraced the outdoors, spending my summers as a river guide 
          and my winters snowboarding and working as a sales supervisor at Taos Ski Valley.
          However, my passion for technology led me to a recent transition into a full-time 
          IT professional role at Taos Ski Valley, though I still guide on the weekends. 
          Outside of learning a new function or scouting a rapid, you can find me 
          snowboarding at TSV, floating on my Onewheel, or undertaking a project with 
          my wife.</p>

      <h2>My Wife</h2>
      <p>
          A big shout-out to my incredible wife, Hannah Beck, who is the proud owner of 
          <a href="https://taosbestcleaning.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taos Best Cleaning</a>. Together, 
          we've explored mountains and rivers, building a beautiful life in Taos with
          our two dogs and cat. 
      </p>

      <h2>My Career</h2>
      <p>
          My journey has been a blend of diverse experiences. From navigating 
          the outdoors to diving into the ever-evolving world of IT, I am now focusing 
          on expanding my development skills.
